# Invisible Man
- Forget about Harry's invisibility cloak.  
- In today's lazy world everyone wants to do minimum amount of work and get maximum amount of results.   
- No one has the time to find out a cloak and cast some spells onto it and convert it inot a invisibility cloak.  
- That's why I created this thing.  
- Just run the script and you will see (actually won't be able to see yourself) magic.  
- 
- Enough of that ðŸ˜‚  
- 
- Actually I have used Mask RCNN for implementing human segmentation.  
- The dataset was trained on COCO dataset.  
- But the thing is that Mask RCNNs are way too slow. 
 
## So --> GPU required
